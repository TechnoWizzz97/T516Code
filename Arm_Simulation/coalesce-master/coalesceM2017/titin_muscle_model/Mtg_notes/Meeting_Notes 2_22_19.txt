mass of pulley may not be tuned right (?)
    -make Mp an optimization parameter ??
    
best simulation?
Kiisa suggested using an inverted pendulum model

simulating a guinea fowl gastrocnemius - compound muscle

activation signal precedes foot hitting the ground
when no resistance to shortening, shortens very fast

Kiisa IS using the F-V relationship

Fact that muscle is activating for entire duration of shortening is a result of the unpredictability of when the foot will hit the ground

Solve for different perturbations and find the most stable results

Monica can grab parameters from other muscles ( medial gastrocnemius & soleus )

If entire mass of triceps surae is known we would use all of the 'calf' muscles

Titin Model IS NOT THE FULL MTU! JUST THE "M"

'Twitch' delay time is ~20-25ms

Kiisa interested in modeling length dependent properties of muscle

Achilles tendon for guinea fowl parameters are well-documented

Isotonic F-V relationship    ( isotonic - constant force )
    - not the right relationship to use

Hill model explains 35% variation in force
    Titin Model explains 99% variation in force

"Prediction of force on Hill Models is very poor" -Kiisa Nishikawa
    -Very driven by activation
    Activation is everything & length is almost nothing (for Hill)

Fundamental question of why muscles activate the way they activate in the context of locomotion (early - & pre contact)
