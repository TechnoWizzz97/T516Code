For isometric... CONTRACTILE ELEMENT FIXED!!!

minimize contributions of series elasticity

activation is adjusted to reach a steady-state force output
    just enough to reach toe force but not act against the load
    
Activation/deactivation kinetics
    twitch results in force profile which happens over duration
        asymmetric profile (peaks faster than declines)
        
        Better Objective Function?
            Monica says save for later
            

Tune system so that period of oscillations is in sync with the task at hand
